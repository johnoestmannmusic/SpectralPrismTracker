# 0007-Electron — Lantern Music Player (TypeScript / Electron) — Project Kanban

How to use:
This file is the shared Kanban Markdown coordination board for porting the
Rust egui/eframe Lantern Music Player (`../SourceRepo/1000-shrines-of-spirit/src/0007/`)
to a TypeScript Electron application in this repository.
Agents should only assign themselves to cards not already assigned, move cards
between buckets instead of duplicating them, preserve card IDs, and append dated
process comments after each completed feature or verification.
Buckets: **Ideas**, **Bugs**, **Planned Features**, **Assigned**, **Completed**.
A found bug gets a card in Bugs (symptom, root cause once known, fix approach);
once verified fixed it moves to Completed like any other card, keeping its ID.
Dates include a time (HH:MM).

## Project: 0007-Electron — Lantern Music Player (TypeScript / Electron)

**Project Title:** 0007-Electron — Lantern Music Player (TypeScript / Electron)
**Project Description:** Reimplement the Rust egui/eframe Lantern Music Player
as a TypeScript + Electron desktop app. Web Audio (Chromium) replaces the Rust
web audio backend; the Spectral engine's `prism_dsp` phase vocoder is compiled
to WebAssembly and called from TypeScript.
**Source of Truth (Rust):** `../SourceRepo/1000-shrines-of-spirit/src/0007/` at
commit `5948fdc` ("Handover").
**Rust Kanban:** `../SourceRepo/1000-shrines-of-spirit/src/0007/manage/KANBAN.md`
**Parity Checklist:** `../SourceRepo/1000-shrines-of-spirit/src/0007/PARITY.md`
**Original HTML:** `../SourceRepo/1000-shrines-of-spirit/src/0006/index.html`

### Branding (user-confirmed)

- **Font:** the bundled Medodica Regular (`MedodicaRegular.otf`), exposed as the
  `"Medodica"` CSS family. (User wrote "Melodica"; the asset/upstream family is
  Medodica — flag if the file should be renamed.)
- **Light theme is the default** (the `System` option is removed). Light uses
  the brand green `#6cd73c` on `#ffffff` panels.
- **Dark theme** remains available via the header toggle; choice persists in
  `localStorage`.

### How this backlog was produced (2026-09-12 18:10)

A fresh parity audit compared the Electron port against:
1. the Rust `manage/KANBAN.md` "Technical Handoff Notes" (the authoritative
   feature description of the shipped Rust app),
2. every Rust Completed card (`0006-PLAN-001..031`, `0006-BUG-001..008`,
   `0006-DONE-001..007`, `0006-IDEA-001..003`),
3. `PARITY.md`'s functional checklist and "Audio and editor behaviours" list,
4. direct inspection of `lantern-app/src/{app,pattern,editor,cover}.rs`.

Cards below are **features present in Rust but missing or partial in the
Electron port**. Rust's own only-open item — `0006-PLAN-025`'s `.FUR` writer —
is *also* unimplemented in Rust (both apps passthrough the loaded bytes), so it
is captured as an optional card, not a parity gap.

### Technical Handoff Notes

- **Porting map (Rust -> TS):**
  | Rust | TS location |
  | --- | --- |
  | `lantern-fur` | `src/core/fur/` |
  | `lantern-core` | `src/core/{songModel,timing,pitch,sampler,spectral,project,export,midi,dsp,tracker}.ts` |
  | `lantern-audio` (web) | `src/audio/{backend,webSampler,webAudioBackend}.ts` |
  | `lantern-app` | `src/renderer/` (React) |
  | `prism_dsp` | `native/prism-wasm/` -> `src/renderer/vendor/prism/` + `src/wasm/{prism,prism.worker,prismWorkerClient,prismWorkerProtocol}.ts` |
  | folder/file I/O | `src/main/` + `src/preload/` |
- **Dropped by design:** native `rodio` backend, `eframe` storage, `trunk`
  packaging, `System` theme.
- **Byte-format contracts:** WAV PCM16 (LE asymmetric scaling), ZIP STORE
  (DOS date `0x0021`, CRC-32), MIDI (`TICKS_PER_ROW = 24`, big-endian, no
  running status), Project JSON v1 (camelCase, legacy `rootNote` migration,
  Rust serde `NoteValue` encoding), cover PRNG seed `9001`, offline mixdown
  PRNG seed `"LANTERN\x01"`.
- **WASM build:** `npm run build:prism-wasm` uses `wasm-bindgen-cli` after
  `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`; output committed under
  `native/prism-wasm/pkg/` and copied to `src/renderer/vendor/prism/`.

### Commands

```
npm run dev              # Vite renderer + Electron (renderer hot reload)
npm run build            # esbuild main/preload + vite renderer -> dist/
npm run typecheck        # renderer + node tsconfigs
npm test                 # Vitest unit tests
npm run test:e2e         # Playwright Electron smoke test (needs dist/)
npm run audit:deps       # dependency-provenance / slopsquatting audit
npm run build:prism-wasm # rebuild prism_dsp WASM (needs wasm-bindgen-cli)
npm run build:web        # static web build -> dist/web (Electron + browser)
npm run serve:web        # serve dist/web for browser testing
npm run test:web         # Playwright browser test against dist/web (uses Chrome)
npm run test:all         # typecheck + unit + audit + build + web + e2e
```

### Verification baseline (2026-09-12 22:20)

- `npm run typecheck` — clean.
- `npx vitest run` — **6 files, 37 tests passing**, including the real
  `prism_dsp` WASM engine (freeze + cross-synth) instantiated in-process.
- `npm run audit:deps` — 40 checks passed, 0 failures; 172 transitive lockfile
  packages registry-resolved with sha512.
- `npm run build` — renderer 326 kB JS + 326 kB WASM (102 kB gzip) + hashed font.
- `npx playwright test` — 7 tests: smoke, EDIT MODE (select/navigate + centred
  scroll), editor modal, project (confirm New Project + hamburger delete),
  features (comments/Base Tempo/no audition error), and JSON Load auto-apply.

## Ideas

- **0007E-IDEA-001** — Spectrogram/FFT inspector panel using prism_dsp frames.
- **0007E-IDEA-002** — `electron-builder` packaging; compress/generate the
  ~38 MB CHIP mix WAV. (Rust: `0006-PLAN-006` was scrapped; user deploys.)
- **0007E-IDEA-004** — Additional Furnace chip-system support beyond Game Boy.
  (Rust `0006-IDEA-001`; out of current parity scope.)
- **0007E-IDEA-005** — Persistent Fusion render cache keyed by source + settings
  fingerprint. (Rust `0006-IDEA-002`.)
- **0007E-IDEA-006** — Mobile-focused compact layout validated on real mobile
  browsers. (Rust `0006-IDEA-003`.)

## Bugs

_(none open — see 0007E-BUG-001…008 in Completed)_

## Planned Features — Remaining Rust parity backlog

All tracked Rust-parity cards except the optional Rust-deferred `.FUR` writer
have now landed.

- **0007E-PLAN-051** — *Optional (mirrors Rust's own open item):* **Save .FUR
  writer from live editor state** (splice SNG2/PATN, recompute the block-pointer
  table, re-wrap in zlib). Rust deliberately deferred this because it could not
  validate against a real Furnace install; both apps currently pass through the
  loaded bytes. Verify against a real Furnace build before trusting it.

## Assigned

_(none currently)_

## Completed

- **0007E-PLAN-000** — Architecture analysis. *(2026-09-12 17:10)* Mapped all
  four Rust crates + `prism_dsp`; confirmed Electron/Chromium → port the web
  backend, drop `rodio`.
- **0007E-PLAN-001** — Scaffold. *TS 7 removed `baseUrl`; paths are `./src/*`.*
- **0007E-PLAN-002/003/004** — Core ports: `.fur` parser (INF2/SNG2/ADIR/INS2/
  WAVE/PATN/legacy INFO), song model + timelines, timing, pitch, sampler
  settings + look-ahead `Scheduler`, project v1 schema, WAV/ZIP, MIDI writer,
  offline `renderSamplerMix`. Verified against the v251 and v181 fixtures.
- **0007E-PLAN-005** — Unit tests (parser, model, scheduler, envelopes,
  ping-pong, project, WAV/ZIP, MIDI, mixdown, tracker helpers, WASM).
- **0007E-PLAN-006/007/008** — Web Audio backend + React vertical slice +
  Electron main/preload; verified by E2E.
- **0007E-PLAN-009/010** — Slopsquatting dependency audit + Playwright E2E.
- **0007E-PLAN-011b** — prism_dsp WASM build + Spectral wiring (8 modes).
- **0007E-PLAN-012** — Cover art, piano visualiser, Light/Dark theming.
- **0007E-PLAN-013** — Tracker EDIT MODE (selection/keybinds/copy/paste/
  interpolate/Pattern Manager/undo-redo).
- **0007E-PLAN-014** — Sampler + Spectral editor windows.
- **0007E-PLAN-015** — Folder-load / song-swap.
- **0007E-PLAN-016** — Exports/IO (FUR/MIDI/JSON/WAV/ZIP).
- **0007E-PLAN-017** — Transport/audition/sample waveforms.
- **0007E-PLAN-018** — Source Sample windows.
- **0007E-BUG-001** — 2-byte `tagEquals` bug. Fixed; regression-tested.
- **0007E-PLAN-019/021/022/023/024/025 — Sidebar chrome.** *(2026-09-12 18:15)*
  Hover Explainer card (shared React context, wired to tracker cells/rows/
  channels and mixer/instrument hovers), Song Comments, editable-in-EDIT-MODE
  Timing card (BPM + tick rate/speed/virtual tempo/highlights applied live and
  retimed), Chips card, Licenses + page links, and editable Title/Artist/Album.
- **0007E-PLAN-027/028/029/030 — Quick edits.** *(2026-09-12 18:15)* Editable
  channel/master dB text fields (commit on Enter/blur, `-∞` support), editable
  instrument colour swatch, name, and dB volume.
- **0007E-PLAN-033/034/035/036 — Tracker improvements.** *(2026-09-12 18:15)*
  X clears an active range; plain Space starts from the viewed pattern's row 0
  with Ctrl+Space resuming; "Order" renamed to "Pattern" with a current-pattern
  colour swatch; beat/bar guide lines now follow `highlight_a`/`highlight_b`.
- **0007E-PLAN-041/042/043/044/045 — Editor completeness.** *(2026-09-12 18:15)*
  Freeze-point waveform drag (A and B); shared Spectral ENVELOPE section;
  Spectral Result waveform with status and playheads; fusion lifecycle (render
  then re-trim, `setSpectralEnabled` on tab/pill switch, Project JSON import
  reconstructs renders preserving saved trim); tab↔pill engine sync.
- **0007E-BUG-002 — Tracker selection invisible.** *(2026-09-12 18:10)* Cell
  `className` had dropped the `tracker-cell` class, so `.tracker-cell.selected`
  / `.tracker-cell.in-range` never matched and EDIT MODE looked non-functional.
  Fixed by prefixing every tracker cell with `tracker-cell`; regression test
  `tests/e2e/edit.spec.ts` verifies select/navigate/edit.
- **0007E-BUG-003 — Sampler/Spectral close button dead.** *(2026-09-12 18:10)*
  The title-bar drag handler called `setPointerCapture` on pointerdown, which
  retargeted the subsequent `click` away from the ✕ button. Fixed by ignoring
  pointerdowns originating on a button and stopping propagation on the close
  button; regression test `tests/e2e/editor.spec.ts`.
- **0007E-BUG-004 — "Unmute" UI hang.** *(2026-09-12 18:25)* Mitigated: per-panel
  frame updates throttled, `songPositionAt` no longer allocates a `rowTimes`
  slice per call, and Spectral re-render is guarded to genuine Spectral
  param/source changes. Feel should be re-confirmed on the user's machine.
- **0007E-BUG-005 — Scroll-while-playing hang.** *(2026-09-12 18:25)* Mitigated
  by the same throttling: Mixer/Transport/PatternGrid at 20 fps,
  Piano/SourceSamples at 12 fps, Piano skips idle frames, SourceSamples
  de-dupes duration updates.
- **0007E-BUG-006 — Spectral Sample A source picker missing.** *(2026-09-12
  18:25)* Added a Sample A Source selector to the Spectral tab.
- **0007E-PLAN-026 — Persistent local editor state.** *(2026-09-12 18:25)*
  Mutes, instrument display names/colours and Ref Pitch persist to
  `localStorage` (`lantern-local-state-v1`) and restore over the project on load.
- **0007E-PLAN-031 — Transpose preview.** *(2026-09-12 18:25)* Table −/+ now
  clamp and preview via `onTransposeAdjust`.
- **0007E-PLAN-032 — CHIP-mode instrument preview.** *(2026-09-12 18:25)* In CHIP
  mode, instrument Preview finds a pattern occurrence (`findInstrumentSpot`)
  and auditions the stem slice.
- **0007E-PLAN-037 — Tracker note-trigger flashes.** *(2026-09-12 18:25)* Note
  starts briefly outline the cell in the accent colour.
- **0007E-PLAN-039 — Per-column interpolate menu.** *(2026-09-12 18:25)* One
  Interpolate entry per selected column.
- **0007E-PLAN-046 — Clear Samples resets editor state.** *(2026-09-12 18:25)*
  Also resets ADSR to the defaults.
- **0007E-PLAN-050 — Theme-following waveform colours.** *(2026-09-12 18:25)*
  Waveforms read the `--wave` theme variable.
- **0007E-PLAN-020 — Cross-channel range selection.** *(2026-09-12 18:40)*
  `tracker.ts` now exposes a global flat-column space (`flatColumns`,
  `globalColumnIndex`, `columnInRect`) and `selectionRect` spans channels.
  Shift-select, Ctrl+C/V + flood paste, X-range-clear, interpolate and Ctrl/Cmd+A
  all operate across channels; unit test asserts a CH0→CH1 rectangle and
  `inSelection` membership.
- **0007E-PLAN-038 — Frozen multi-row tracker headers.** *(2026-09-12 18:40)*
  Both header rows use explicit non-overlapping sticky offsets (0 / 28px) and
  the channel header `colSpan` now tracks the real effect-column count.
- **0007E-PLAN-040 — Draggable ADSR graph.** *(2026-09-12 18:40)* New
  `AdsrGraph` renders the envelope with three draggable handles (attack,
  decay/sustain, release), alongside the numeric sliders; E2E asserts the
  handles render.
- **0007E-PLAN-047 — Per-panel audio errors.** *(2026-09-12 18:40)* New
  `AudioError` component polls the backend and shows a red inline label under
  the player; no longer only the global banner.
- **0007E-PLAN-048 — Legacy Project JSON compatibility.** *(2026-09-12 18:40)*
  Import now falls back to the legacy `spectralFusion` object, aliases the old
  `spectral-blend` mode to `cross-synth`, and maps unknown modes to `off`
  instead of producing an invalid value; covered by a unit test.
- **0007E-PLAN-049 — Export filename parity.** *(2026-09-12 18:40)* Package
  Samples, sampler WAV and Project JSON filenames now match the Rust fallbacks
  (`project.songTitle`, else the Rust default string) exactly.
- **0007E-BUG-007 — `Z` key ("enter last value") was dead code.** *(2026-09-12
  19:15)* Found during a fresh parity pass: `PatternGrid.tsx`'s `z` handler
  read the current cell's value and discarded it, writing back an unchanged
  cell, even though the Keyboard Help modal advertised "enter last value /
  repeat." Fixed by porting Rust's per-column-type memory
  (`lantern-app/src/pattern.rs`'s `last_note`/`last_ins`/`last_vol`/`last_fx`,
  defaulting to C-4/0/15/`{0,0}`) into `src/core/tracker.ts` as
  `defaultLastValues`/`recordLastValue`/`applyLastValue`, hooked into
  `PatternGrid.tsx`'s shared `commit()` (used by both keybind edits and the
  right-click menu, matching Rust's `commit_edit`) so paste/interpolate still
  do not affect it. Covered by new cases in `tests/unit/tracker.test.ts`.
- **0007E-PLAN-052 — Sidebar width parity.** *(2026-09-12 19:15)* `.sidebar`
  was 320px; the Rust/original spec is 300px. One-line CSS fix.
- **0007E-PLAN-053 — Spectral Worker (was 0007E-IDEA-003).** *(2026-09-12
  19:15)* `prism_dsp` Spectral renders now run in a dedicated Web Worker
  (`src/wasm/prism.worker.ts` + `prismWorkerClient.ts`, request/response
  protocol in `prismWorkerProtocol.ts`) instead of blocking the main thread;
  `initPrismWasm` tries the Worker first and falls back to the previous
  main-thread WASM path if the Worker can't start. This finally gives real
  meaning to `AudioBackend`'s `fusionRendering`/`takeFusionCompleted`, which
  every implementation (Rust and TS) had hardcoded to `false`/no-op since
  rendering was always synchronous — `SamplerEngine.renderSpectral` now
  tracks per-instrument in-flight/completed state and discards stale results
  when a newer render supersedes an older one for the same instrument.
  `SamplerEditor`'s Spectral tab shows "Rendering…" and disables Render while
  a render is in flight. Verified end-to-end in the built app (Playwright):
  Render correctly shows "Rendering…" then "Rendered result is ready.", no
  console errors, no Worker-init fallback warning logged. New tests:
  `tests/unit/prism-worker-client.test.ts` (protocol, injected fake
  transport), `tests/unit/webSampler.test.ts` (stale-render discard).

- **0007E-BUG-008 — Tracker did not follow the playhead or the selected EDIT
  cell.** *(2026-09-12 19:20)* The React grid rendered a plain scroll container
  with no scroll-to logic, unlike Rust's `TableBuilder::scroll_to_row`. Added a
  `trackerRef` plus per-row refs and a post-render effect that keeps the playhead
  row or the selected EDIT cell **centred** in the scroll area (below the sticky
  header);
  regression test `tests/e2e/edit.spec.ts` asserts the selection stays inside the
  viewport after 45 ArrowDowns.

- **0007E-PLAN-054 — New Project button.** *(2026-09-12 19:45)* Toolbar button
  clears every pattern (one empty pattern per channel), resets to a single
  instrument with default sampler settings and a default name/colour, and sets
  Title/Author/Album to "New Song"/"Unknown Artist"/"New Album". Loaded Source
  Samples are retained from the folder; Project JSON overrides are refreshed.
- **0007E-PLAN-055 — Add / Delete instruments.** *(2026-09-12 19:45)*
  "+ Add Instrument" appends a blank Game Boy instrument with default settings
  and a golden-angle colour. Each row gains a Delete button (disabled on the
  last remaining instrument); deleting remaps every pattern INS cell via
  `remapInstrumentsAfterDelete` (references to it cleared, higher indices
  shifted down), rebuilds timelines/timing, re-syncs the backend sequence and
  settings, and closes or shifts any open editor. Covered by E2E
  `tests/e2e/project.spec.ts` and a unit test for the remap.

- **0007E-PLAN-056 — Follow Playhead stays on in EDIT MODE.** *(2026-09-12 20:20)*
  Default `true`; removed the automatic `setFollow(false)` from cell selection,
  vertical navigation and the pattern dropdown. The checkbox remains the only
  way to turn it off.
- **0007E-PLAN-057 — New Project resets volume levels.** *(2026-09-12 20:20)*
  Channel volumes -> 1.0, mutes -> off, master -> 1.0, pushed to the backend
  and written to the Project JSON fields.
- **0007E-PLAN-058 — Editable Base Tempo (BPM).** *(2026-09-12 20:20)* New
  EDIT-MODE field in the Timing card; editing back-solves
  `tickRate = bpm × highlightA × speed / 60` (clamped 1..1000), reusing the
  existing retime/sequence/`tickRateOverride` path.
- **0007E-PLAN-059 — ADSR attack fade-in.** *(2026-09-12 20:20)* The graph now
  draws a zero-volume baseline and start marker and enforces a minimum
  on-screen attack ramp so short attacks still read as a fade-in (display only;
  audio unchanged).
- **0007E-PLAN-060 — Ref Pitch removed from the header.** *(2026-09-12 20:20)*
  Kept in the instrument editor only; persistence unchanged.
- **0007E-PLAN-061 — Project JSON Load.** *(2026-09-12 20:20)* Hidden
  `<input type="file" accept=".json,application/json">`; reads the file into
  the JSON textarea. Works in all target browsers (no grey-out needed).
- **0007E-PLAN-062 — New Project confirmation.** *(2026-09-12 20:20)* Toolbar
  button opens a confirm modal before resetting.
- **0007E-PLAN-063 — Instrument delete behind a hamburger + confirm.**
  *(2026-09-12 20:20)* Per-row `☰` menu with "Delete instrument…" and a
  confirmation modal; disabled on the last instrument.
- **0007E-PLAN-064 — Song Comments always present + EDIT-MODE editable.**
  *(2026-09-12 20:20)* Panel always renders (collapsible); read-only with
  `song.meta.comment` fallback, `<textarea>` bound to `project.comments` in
  EDIT MODE.
- **0007E-PLAN-065 — Spurious "Cannot Audition" fixed.** *(2026-09-12 20:20)*
  `previewPattern` silently skips not-ready/not-assigned/empty-trim instead of
  setting a persistent `webError`; `onAudition` skips source-less and
  not-yet-rendered Spectral instruments; `AudioError` is now dismissible.
  New E2E `tests/e2e/features.spec.ts`.

- **0007E-PLAN-066 — Spectral Render button removed.** *(2026-09-12 20:35)*
  Spectral edits already re-render automatically (`onUpdateSetting` /
  `applyEngine`), so the manual Render button was redundant; the tab now shows
  the rendering/ready status only.
- **0007E-PLAN-067 — Project JSON Load auto-applies.** *(2026-09-12 20:35)*
  `applyProjectText` now takes the text directly; `loadProjectFile` reads the
  chosen file and applies it immediately, closing the modal. New E2E
  `features.spec.ts` verifies title + modal close.
- **0007E-PLAN-068 — Ctrl+Space plays from the selected EDIT cell.**
  *(2026-09-12 20:35)* `PatternGrid` reports the selection to App; in EDIT MODE
  Ctrl+Space seeks/plays from that cell's row instead of the current time.

- **0007E-PLAN-069 — Instrument volume dB entry fixed (0 dB max).**
  *(2026-09-12 21:10)* New shared `DbInput` keeps a local text buffer and
  commits on Enter/blur, so typing "-2" is no longer reformatted mid-edit; the
  instrument rack caps at 0 dB (1.0 linear).
- **0007E-PLAN-070 — Base Tempo field typing fixed.** *(2026-09-12 21:10)* The
  BPM box now buffers its text and commits on Enter/blur, so large values like
  150 are not clamped to 2.5 while typing.
- **0007E-PLAN-071 — ADSR ranges up to 5s.** *(2026-09-12 21:10)* Attack/decay/
  release sliders, graph drag clamps, `envelopeAt`, `buildVoice`, voice release
  and offline mixdown clamps all raised to 5 s; graph x-domain widened to 15.3 s.
- **0007E-PLAN-072 — ADSR graph zero-origin fixed.** *(2026-09-12 21:10)* The
  first vertex used raw `0` (top of the inverted y axis) instead of `py(0)`, so
  the attack looked flat at max volume. Now it starts at the bottom and ramps to
  max, with the zero baseline and minimum display ramp.
- **0007E-PLAN-073 — Error banner dismiss button.** *(2026-09-12 21:10)* The
  red error strip now has an explicit ✕ close button (e.g. after a bad JSON
  load); previously only the whole strip was clickable.
- **0007E-PLAN-074 — Sticky right-hand sidebar.** *(2026-09-12 21:10)* Matches
  the original (`position: sticky; top: 12px`) on wide screens, reverting to
  static in the narrow breakpoint.
- **0007E-PLAN-075 — Richer hover explainer text.** *(2026-09-12 21:10)* Ported
  the descriptive copy from the original HTML's `EXPLAIN` registry into
  `src/renderer/explainerContent.ts` and wired it to the tracker (rows, cells,
  channels, patterns), mixer, instruments (name/transpose/dB), source samples,
  cover art, piano, timing, chips, comments, toolbar and the Spectral tab.
- **0007E-PLAN-076 — Reduced sample popping.** *(2026-09-12 21:10)* One-shot
  voices get a 5 ms end fade (an envelope-accurate ramp to 0) and raw source
  previews fade out before stopping, removing end-of-sample clicks. Should be
  re-confirmed by ear; loop seams already had 5 ms fades.

- **0007E-PLAN-077 — Instrument row flash on trigger.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)*
  Instrument rows briefly flash in the accent colour when a note using them
  starts. *(item 1)*
- **0007E-PLAN-078 — Sidebar text +4px.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)* Right-hand panel
  text (Explainer, Comments, Timing, Chips, Mixer) increased ~4px. *(item 2)*
- **0007E-PLAN-079 — Sidebar/scrollbar gap.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)* Added
  `padding-right: 10px` so panel content doesn't touch the scrollbar. *(item 3)*
- **0007E-PLAN-080 — ADSR recreated from the original 0006 logic.**
  *(2026-09-12 22:20)* Canvas graph: fixed x-axis (stage max + nominal hold),
  4px padding, filled amber curve, three draggable points; removed the earlier
  min-width distortion. *(item 4)*
- **0007E-PLAN-081 — Explainer colour-coding + code blocks.** *(2026-09-12
  22:20)* Explainer bodies auto-highlight numbers/identifiers/keywords and
  render formula lines as code blocks, matching the original's `tk-*` style.
  *(item 5)*
- **0007E-PLAN-082 — All modals draggable.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)* New
  `DraggableModal` used by Project JSON, Sample Info, Clear Samples, New
  Project, Delete Instrument, Pattern Manager, Keyboard Help and Clear Patterns.
  *(item 6)*
- **0007E-PLAN-083 — Delete instrument asks remove vs re-assign.** *(2026-09-12
  22:20)* Prompt with "remove all notes" or "re-assign to <instrument>";
  `reassignInstrument` re-targets INS cells. Also clears loop caches via
  `replaceSettings`, fixing post-delete "Cannot play sample" errors. *(item 7)*
- **0007E-PLAN-084 — Explainer fixed height, no scroll.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)*
  Fixed panel height sized to the longest authored body (~246 chars) with a
  320-char cap enforced at render. *(item 8)*
- **0007E-PLAN-085 — Theme fade transition.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)*
  0.3s background/colour/border transitions across panels and controls. *(item 9)*
- **0007E-PLAN-086 — Mixer mute buttons.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)* Channel
  checkboxes replaced with CH{n} Mute buttons in the instrument style. *(item 10)*
- **0007E-PLAN-087 — Muted instrument rows semi-transparent.** *(2026-09-12
  22:20)* *(item 11)*
- **0007E-PLAN-088 — JSON load adopts its instrument count.** *(2026-09-12
  22:20)* Grows with blank instruments or shrinks (clearing out-of-range INS
  cells) to match the file instead of erroring. *(item 12)*
- **0007E-PLAN-089 — Package Samples removed from the toolbar.** *(2026-09-12
  22:20)* Still available in the Source Samples panel. *(item 13)*
- **0007E-PLAN-090 — Song panel engine label.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)* Shows
  `SAMPLER`, `SAMPLER / SPECTRALPRISM` (any instrument in Spectral), or
  `Game Boy` in CHIP mode. *(item 14)*
- **0007E-PLAN-091 — Title build number.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)* Heading is now
  `Lantern Music Player vYYYYMMDD`. *(item 15)*
- **0007E-PLAN-092 — Spectral modal title trimmed.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)* No
  date; just "SpectralPrism". *(item 16)*
- **0007E-PLAN-093 — Instrument previews at C5.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)* Preview
  voice rate/reference tone shifted from A4 to C5. *(item 17)*
- **0007E-PLAN-094 — CHIP MODE disabled style + tooltip.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)*
  When stems are missing the button is dimmed with a hover tooltip; New Project
  now marks stems unavailable. *(item 18)*
- **0007E-PLAN-095 — EDIT MODE blue accent.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)*
  `data-mode="edit"` switches the accent to `#3ea3e3`; CHIP/SAMPLER stay green.
  *(item 19)*
- **0007E-PLAN-096 — Click-drag cell selection.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)*
  Mouse-drag across cells extends the selection like Shift. *(item 20)*
- **0007E-PLAN-097 — Ctrl+X cut.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)* Copies the selection to
  the clipboard, then clears it. *(item 21)*
- **0007E-PLAN-098 — Visible/editable pattern number.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)*
  Pattern Manager shows a `PAT xx` badge per position and an editable number
  input (channel 0's pattern index, stable across reordering). *(item 22)*
- **0007E-PLAN-099 — Lighter Project JSON.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)* Pattern
  snapshots now store only non-empty cells as sparse `[row, cell]` pairs (still
  reads the dense legacy form); empty metadata/mutes/source samples omitted.
  *(item 23)*
- **0007E-PLAN-100 — Toolbar reordered/trimmed.** *(2026-09-12 22:20)* Removed
  Load Song Folder and Package Samples; order is Save .FUR, Save .MIDI,
  Save .WAV, Project JSON, New Project. *(items 24, 25, 26)*

- **0007E-PLAN-101 — Project JSON modal opens instantly.** *(2026-09-12 22:35)*
  The modal now paints immediately; the (sometimes large) serialization runs on
  the next tick and fills the textarea after. *(item 1)*
- **0007E-PLAN-102 — Instrument Pan + Random Pan Width.** *(2026-09-12 22:35)*
  `SamplerSettings` gains a `pan` centre (-1..1), and `panRandomRange` is now
  the random width around that centre; wired through the live Web Audio voice,
  the offline mixdown, Project JSON, and the instrument rows / Sampler editor.
  *(item 2)*

- **0007E-PLAN-103 — Q/A/W/S edit every highlighted cell.** *(2026-09-12 22:55)*
  In EDIT MODE, Q/A/W/S now adjust all cells in the active selection range
  (Shift or drag), not just the focus cell. *(item 1)*
- **0007E-PLAN-104 — Instrument rows fit without horizontal scroll.**
  *(2026-09-12 22:55)* Rows wrap instead of scrolling horizontally; the name
  input is narrower. *(item 2)*
- **0007E-PLAN-105 — Web build.** *(2026-09-12 22:55)* New browser platform
  layer (`src/renderer/platform.ts`) so the same renderer runs in Electron or
  the browser: bundled assets are fetched from `./assets/`, `.fur` zlib is
  inflated with `DecompressionStream`, saves become Blob downloads and file
  picks use `<input type="file">`. `npm run build:web` emits a static
  `dist/web/` (assets copied, minus the large CHIP mix WAV) and
  `npm run test:web` loads it in a real browser. *(item 3)*

- **0007E-BUG-009 — Clicking a tracker cell turned off Follow Playhead.**
  *(2026-09-12 23:05)* The drag-select `beginDrag` (fired on mouse-down for
  every cell click) still called `setFollow(false)`, left over from before the
  "follow stays on while editing" change. Removed it, so Follow Playhead is now
  only ever toggled by its checkbox. Regression assertion added to
  `tests/e2e/edit.spec.ts` (click a cell, then expect the checkbox checked).

- **0007E-PLAN-106 — Project files use the `.lampjson` extension.**
  *(2026-09-12 23:20)* Downloaded project files are now `*.lampjson`; the
  Project JSON **Load** picker accepts `.lampjson` (plus legacy `.json` for
  backward compatibility), and the Electron save dialog filters by the
  suggested extension (a "Lantern Project" filter for `.lampjson`). Folder
  assembly accepts `lmp-default-proj.lampjson` or `.json`. The bundled default
  asset keeps its `.json` name since it is an internal asset / folder
  convention, not a user-saved project.

- **0007E-PLAN-107 — Strict `.lampjson` only.** *(2026-09-12 23:35)* The Load
  picker now accepts only `.lampjson` and rejects anything else with an inline
  error (even if the OS picker allows "all files"); the `.json` save filter was
  dropped; folder assembly requires `lmp-default-proj.lampjson`; and the bundled
  default asset was renamed to `lmp-default-proj.lampjson`. Regression test:
  loading a `.json` file shows ".lampjson" in the error banner and keeps the
  modal open.
