///
/// Making the wraparound itself click-free (not just an integer hop count)
/// takes two things working together, since the frozen resynthesis keeps
/// advancing each bin's phase hop after hop indefinitely:
/// 1. **Phase-locking** (`quantize_advance_for_loop`): each bin's per-hop
///    phase advance is snapped to the nearest value that completes a whole
///    number of cycles over exactly `num_hops` hops. That makes the
///    oscillator bank's phase state after `num_hops` hops identical to its
///    state at hop 0 - the synthesized signal is now genuinely periodic
///    with period `out_len`, not just "long enough that repetition is hard
///    to notice."
/// 2. **Circular OLA** (`ola_accumulate_circular`): the last frame's tail,
///    which would normally spill past the end of the buffer and get
///    dropped, is wrapped back around to the start instead - exactly what
///    would happen if the (now-periodic) frame sequence simply carried on
///    forever. Without this, the first ~`HOP_SIZE` samples would be
///    under-windowed (no "previous frame" to overlap with), which is its
///    own source of a seam even with perfectly phase-locked content.
///
/// Together these make the loop mathematically periodic rather than merely
/// smoothed at the join - no time-domain crossfade/blend is applied (an
/// earlier attempt at that masked the click's magnitude but introduced its
/// own audible comb-filtering/phasing from summing two out-of-phase
/// snapshots of the same oscillators, which is why this replaced it rather
/// than being layered on top of it).
///
/// Stereo width is baked in here rather than applied as a post-process on
/// the rendered audio, because a mid-side transform on already-rendered
/// audio can only ever *reveal* difference that already exists between
/// channels - it cannot create width when the source's L/R are identical or
/// highly correlated (this project's own test sample turned out to have
/// bit-identical L/R channels, which is what exposed this). At
/// `stereo_width_pct == 0` the right channel is built from the LEFT
/// channel's own frozen magnitude/phase/advance (not its own natural
/// analysis), guaranteeing a perfectly centered mono output regardless of
/// the source. As width increases toward 100%, the right channel's
/// magnitude blends toward its own naturally-analyzed content (revealing
/// any real per-channel difference the source has) AND a deterministic
/// per-bin phase offset (`decorrelation_spread`) is added on top, which
/// creates an audible stereo image even when the source has none at all.
